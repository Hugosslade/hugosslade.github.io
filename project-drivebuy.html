                <p>Drive Buy is a fast-paced multiplayer vehicle combat game with cross-play/cross-progression. There are multiple playable characters/vehicles, different game modes and maps, as well as unlockable character customisations.</p>
                <p>I was the Technical Director for this project responsible for the majority of the development as well as briefing, managing and reviewing the work of other team members. I also worked across many other areas including game design and content creation such as customisation unlocks (skins, trails, etc) and multiple game maps.</p>
                <p>I have organized the work I did into different sections highlighting some of the key points for each. For a fuller picture of my role &amp; responsibilities please get in touch using the links at the top of the page.</p>

                <p>I personally developed the AI in it's entirety.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Personality based, such as objective-focused or combat-oriented.</li>
                  <li>Used an action &amp; priority system which was affected differently for each game mode.</li>
                  <li>They can chat and react to other players and other bots using quick chat or the emote system.</li>
                  <li>Their 'inputs' were the same as human players, using line-of-sight and the minimap.</li>
                  <li>Controlled their characters through a virtual gamepad so they couldn't do any impossible or special behaviours.</li>
                  <li>Attract mode for in-person events.
                    <ul>
                      <li>The AI could take over an idle machine and show message enticing players to play.</li>
                      <li>A player could take over the controls and being playing an in-progress game immediately.</li>

                <p>The game supports cross-play and cross-progression using shared player accounts. There is also an event system which controls shop content, double xp weekends, etc. </p>
                <p>The backend system was built using Gamesparks. Here are some of the features I created:</p>

                  <li>Scoped out and briefed an event system which allowed iterative development and future extensibility.</li>
                  <li>Built tools to manage backend and game data allowing non-technical team members to operate autonomously.</li>
                  <li>Integrated all these features into the game.</li>

                <p>Since I was responsible for nearly every single build of the game and the numerous different versions of the game for different scenarios (dev, publisher builds, in-person events, store builds, etc) I had to build a system to help me manage everything.</p>
                <p>The base building blocks of my solution were Scripting Define Symbols as they let me discretely manage features as needed. I also used different settings for libraries and assets but that was on a platform-by-platform level was only useful for more general issues (e.g. no Discord integration on Nintendo Switch).</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Created 'Build Definition' objects which contained a list of Scripting Define Symbols with a toggle and a description.</li>
                  <li>Setup Build Definitions for each version, e.g: Steam Development, Steam Demo, Steam Beta, Steam Release, Non-Steam PC In-Person Event, etc, etc.</li>
                  <li>In-person event builds allowed bypassing external auth and a custom LAN mode since the internet at events is often terrible.</li>
                  <li>Integration with Itch.IO's Butler to upload new builds remotely for other team members/my other machines to use.</li>
                  <li>Manage publisher/region specific builds.</li>
                  <li>PC builds in about 40 seconds since majority of content in Addressables. This allowed rapid iteration and testing of builds.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>All these features were made to be simple to use with everything visual in Editor windows.</p>

              <summary class="collapse">
                <p>Localisation was considered from the very start of the project so I developed a framework alongside the project.</p>
                
                <h3>Usage</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Localized strings could be setup directly in Editor and exported out when ready to localise.</li>
                  <li>Localized label component using either Unity's Text or TextMeshPro which handled updating text automatically.</li>
                  <li>Automatic string creation - either through component or tools to easily convert existing text/prefabs to localisation system.</li>
                  <li>Text setup allowed additional format settings allowing simple text substition for dynamic elements such as player name, level, etc</li>
                  <li>Font family &amp; style setup allowed automatic font swapping for any language, maintaining custom styles.</li>
                  <li>All Left-to-right languages supported. <i>RTL support was not required but could be added.</i></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Import / Export</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Export all existing text as CSV with suitable key/group for organization.</li>
                  <li>Import tool using Google Sheets with configurable import map allowing various data setups.</li>
                  <li>Generate JSON files if needed for either each language or all combined.</li>
                  <li>Additionally it creates files for each language with every unique character to use with TextMeshPro to setup Font assets ahead of time for best performance.</li>
                  <li>New localisations added directly into spreadsheet created as reference inside Unity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Remote Update</h3>
                <p>Remote update is not a requirement for the framework and can be enabled/disabled at anytime with a new build.</p>
                <h4>Update with Addressables</h4>
                <p>If your project uses Unity's Addressables package and is setup for remote updates then you can setup an addressable group and the localization framework will handle downloading the new data and updating your game's text.</p>
                <h4>Update with URL</h4>
                <p>A URL can be setup to fetch a JSON file from on every launch. This setup is very simple and supports all platforms.</p>

                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>I developed many tools for use with this framework for different stages of development.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Import - update all text using Google Sheet</li>
                  <li>Export - take all text in game and export to CSV</li>
                  <li>Duplicates - find duplicate text entries and allow removal &amp; replace old instances with new across project.</li>
                  <li>Quick setup - convert any prefab/scene to use the localisation framework &amp; create any new/missing strings ready for export.</li>
                  <li>Localizer Helper - build of game with option to highlight every visible text field and detail where in localization sheet it is, with copy + paste shortcode for convenience.</li>
                  <li>Gibberish mode - Replace your text in editor/build with gibberish to easily find unlocalised strings and test content/font sizing.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I have shipped multiple products using this framework across multiple platforms including desktop, mobile and console.</p>

              <h3>Other Platforms</h3>
              <p>Despite not releasing on the these platforms due to other constraints, I have done the necessary work for the following platforms:</p>
              <h4>MacOS</h4>

              <h4>Mobile</h4>
              <p>I developed full touch screen control support for mobile (bluetooth/mfi controllers also supported) and went through a heavy optimization process.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The game runs at 30FPS on an iPhone 6S (2015) with a peak runtime memory consumption of 85% of limit.</li>
                  <li>Newer iOS and Android models run at 60FPS.</li>
