                <p>Demeo is a cross-platform cooperative adventure for up to four players that recreates all of the magic and camaraderie of gathering around a tabletop with friends to do battle against the forces of evil.</p>
                <p>Requiring strategy, cunning and teamwork, Demeo is a journey through a fantasy world that only the bravest band of heroes can survive. Adventurers, itâ€™s time to unite!</p>
                <p>I was on the team responsible for the social space for this game and additionally collaborated on memory optimization. I was the lead developer for certain features as well as helping on general issues.</p>
                <p>I have organized the work I did into different sections highlighting some of the key points for each. For a fuller picture of my role &amp; responsibilities please get in touch using the links at the top of the page.</p>

                <p>We had a playable arcade machine which ran custom games (made in PICO-8).</p>
                <p>I reworked this machine to meet performance requirements and change it's networking approach. The previous approach required a game to be fully deterministic and when joining a room it would have to simulate every frame of the game to 'catch-up' which often caused 20+ seconds of loading. It also had a constant performance cost even when not interacting with the game to keep it in sync. The new approach synced only the information to sync the visuals + audio rather than recreating the whole game, and it only ran when needed.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>New networking solution to sync entire game in ~10-150 bytes</li>
                  <li>No loading time cost.</li>
                  <li>Performance cost was reduced to 15% of previous implementation.</li>
                  <li>Performance cost only paid while viewing the game rather than constantly.</li>
                  <li>Reduced fidelity version while in distance to also save performance.</li>
                  <li>Developed entirely as a project independent package for reuse in future social spaces.</li>
                  <li>Added new content and fixed bugs in custom game 'Hauntlet'.</li>

                <p>The game used FinalIK to simulate our torso position but for our 12 players this cost 2ms every frame on Quest 1. I wrote a custom IK solver which focussed just on our requirements and performance budgets.</p>

                <p>I was primarily brought into the team for my expertise with packages and modular code. The team had worked on a social space previously but it was highly coupled to the previous game. There was a need to create something more modular and reusable to allow integration with future games.</p>
                <p>The new social space was underway when I joined the team but we worked on a few areas:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Core features of a social space moved into a package.</li>
                  <li>New features were created as packages by default.</li>
                  <li>Iteratively refined each package and created a common interface for extensibility & reusability.</li>
                  <li>Packages I created were adopted on a company-wide level.</li>
                  <li>I contributed to several existing company projects to add new features and fix bugs.</li>
                  <li>The team was able to now maintain multiple live games at once. Bugs and fixes from one game were able to be shared.</li>
